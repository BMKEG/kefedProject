kefedProject
============

High-level build project for all KEfED + OoEVV submodules

![Submodule organization](design/kefed.jpg?raw=true)

We list five submodules in this high-level repo (six, if you include the bmkeg-parent project 
which is needed to keep track of version numbers of Maven dependencies). 
The primary point of contact for applications is 
(B) the [kefedServer](https://github.com/BMKEG/kefedServer) web application 
that provides an web-based interface for kefed designs and data.
